# DNS Tunnelling

This attack is based on sending non-DNS packets trough the 53/UDP port, in order to mock the security systems, such as firewalls. DNS tunnels can be used to establish Command and Control channels, used to manage DDoS attacks. They can also be used to send malwares and provoke damages in an aimed device or set of devices.
